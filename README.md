# Computer Graphics with pbrt

The aim of this project is to
explore and understand the generation of
realistic images through the rendering of a scene,
that in this case, will be a table whose legs are
made of wood and plate made of glass, also
including the camera, and lighting. As a
rendering method pbrt will be used, a physically
based method based on the ray-tracing
algorithm.
